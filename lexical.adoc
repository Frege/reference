# Lexical syntax

## Source code

Source code is a sequence of Unicode code points. It is recommended to keep source code in UTF-8 encoded text files. Compiler supports different encodings through the `-encoding` command line option.

.Example
 # use default encoding of the java platform
 java -jar fregec.jar -encoding DEFAULT your.fr
 # use russian encoding (not tested)
 java -jar fregec.jar -encoding KOI8_R your.fr

## Tokens

### Whitespace

Whitespace can appear in arbitrary quantity between two tokens. However, whitespace at the beginning of a line is syntactically relevant in <<layout>> mode.

Two tokens must be separated by whitespace if the second token is a valid suffix of the first one.

.Greedy Lexing

  v10           -- one token
  v 10          -- two tokens

### Comments

Ordinary comments can appear everywhere whitespace can.

.Line Comment
  -- extends to the end of the line

.Block Comment
  {- extends {- to matching -} closing -}

Block comments do nest and can extend over multiple lines. They can be used to separate tokens.

.Two tokens separated by block comment
  v{-separates!-}10     

.Documentation Comment
[source]
----
  {--
    First paragraph.
    
    Second paragraph.
  -}
  --- this is a single paragraph of documentation
----  

Documentation comments may appear

* before a (non local) function or variable declaration
* immediately before a constructor is introduced
* immediately after the constructor declaration
* after a field declaration

Multiple adjacent documentation comments are joined with a paragraph break inbetween. The documentation text uses an easy <<docmarkup,markup language>>. It can be retrieved from compiled class files.

### Literals

.Integer Literals
  17 0x11 021       -- int value 17 in decimal, hexadecimal and octal
  5_483_438         -- trailing groups of 3 digits can be separated
  123L 217l         -- long values (like in java)
  5467n 7654N       -- big integer literal

.Floating Point Literals
  1.34e-17 1.0d 0D  -- double literals 
  0.2F 2.0f         -- float literal

Either one or more of the fractional part, the exponent or the suffix characters `D`, `F`, `d` or `f` may be omitted, but not all (this would result in an integer literal).

.Boolean Literals
  true false        -- like in Java
  True False        -- like in Haskell
 
#### Quoted constructs

.Character Literals
  'a'
  '\''              -- apostrophe
  '\\'              -- backslash
  '\u2200'          -- the character '‚àÄ'
  '\n'              -- newline
  '\012'            -- yet another newline

All escape characters/sequences allowed in Java are also allowed in Frege. Character literals are 16-bit quantities, like in Java. This means that Unicode code points above 0xffff are not characters in Java and Frege.

.String Literals
  "like in Java"
  "ùï≤ùñîùñôùñôùñëùñîùñá"

Strings can contain any unicode characters. However, code points from the higher plane are encoded as a surrogate pairs.

.Regular Expression Literals
  ¬¥^foo\\¬¥          -- in Java "^foo\\\\", means
                    -- "foo" at the start followed by backslash
  '(foo|bar)'       -- works with upright quotes
                    -- when longer than 1 char
  '(?:)x'           -- trick: same as ¬¥x¬¥

Regular expressions can be given as literals. They are checked for validity at compile time. No backslash dupications needed, as is the case when one specifies them as string in Java.

A quoted construct in upright quotes is interpreted as regular expression literal when it can't possibly be a character. This is for the convenience of those that don't have acute accent marks on their keyboard.

Withing regular expression literals, escape sequences follow the regular expression syntax. For example `\b` is a word break in regular expressions, but a backspace in strings.

### Separators

The following characters are separators and have certain syntactic meanings

  { } [ ] ( ) , ;
  
### Keywords

[source]
----
 abstract case class data default derive deriving do
 else false forall foreign if import in
 infix infixl infixr
 instance interface let module native newtype of
 package private protected public
 then throws true type where
 
 = | \
 -> .. :: <- => 
 ‚Üí  ‚Ä¶  ‚à∑  ‚Üê  ‚áí   ‚àÄ 
----

The last line lists some Unicode symbols that have the same meaning as the 2-character ascii symbols above them. The `‚àÄ` has the same meaning as `forall`.

The following are keywords only when the next token is the keyword `native`

  pure mutable

### Operators

Any sequence of characters that doesn't contain separators, quotes, apostrophes, acute/grave accent marks, letters, digits or whitespace is a lexical operator, unless it is a keyword.

When recognizing operators, the lexer considers the longest sequence of operator characters available. Symbolic keywords are not recognized when they appear as subsequence of an operator.

  ::*           -- operator
  :: *          -- double colon, operator
  

This provides enormous symbolic freedom for user defined operators.

### Variable Names

Are used to name functions, variables, type variables and fields.

  _foo _Foo foo foo' f2o__o'' f'o'o'

  
Variable names start with a lowercase letter or an underscore and may be followed by arbitrary many letters, digits, apostrophes and underscores.

A sole underscore  is a variable name reserved for use in pattern matching, where it indicates an unused value.

For the purpose of Frege, all letters that are not uppercase letters are counted as lowercase.

### Constructor Names

Are used to name namespaces, types, type classes and data constructors. Also, the last component of a module name must lexically be a constructor name.

Such a name starts with an uppercase letter, which may be followed by by an arbitrary number of letters, digits, apostrophes and underscores.

Namespaces can have the same name as types or type classes. Data constructors can have the same name as namespaces, types or type classes.

.A not so extreme example
[source]
----
  module Foo where
  
  data Foo = Foo
----

Editors for Frege should highlight or colour constructor names in such a way that theay are easily distinguished.

### Qualifier

A constructor name immediately followed by `.`
This is used to form qualified names.

### Qualified Names

A name can be qualified by a namespace, a type name or by a namespace and a type name.
Namespace and type name must be given as qualifiers, that is, they must be immediately followed by a dot.

  Foo . bar         -- not a qualified name
  Foo.bar           -- a qualified name
  Foo. bar          -- the same
  Mod.Typ.x         -- fully qualified name
  
### Module names

A sequence of names, separated by dots. 
The last part must be a construtor name. 
Since this will be the fully qualified name of the Java class that is generated for this module, it is expected that the name follows Java customs.

  module org.desperate.programmers.Baz

If the first component of a multi-component name starts with an uppercase letter, `frege.` will be prepended to the name and the uppercase letter will be lower-cased.

   Data.List      -- same as frege.data.List

This is to make Haskell programmers feel home and to save typing.

### Native type names

A fully qualified name of some existing class or interface. If it contains characters  that are not allowed in Frege (like `$`) or words that are keywords, it can be given as a string literal.

[[layout]]
## Layout 

Like in Haskell, Frege code can be written using blocks delimitted by curly braces, where subsequent definitions are separated by semicolons.

In fact, this is the language the parser understands.
The so-called layout feature allows omission of those braces and semicolons, by inferring their positions based on the indentation of the program text and inserting them as needed before parsing.

Informally stated, the braces and semicolons are inserted as follows. 
The layout (or ‚Äùoffside‚Äù) rule takes effect whenever the open brace is omitted after the keyword `where`, `let`, `do`, or `of`.

When this happens, the indentation of the next lexeme (whether or not on a new line) is remembered and the omitted open brace is inserted 
(the whitespace preceding the lexeme may include comments). 

For each subsequent line, 
if it contains only whitespace or is indented more, 
then the previous item is continued (nothing is inserted);
if it is indented the same amount, 
then a new item begins (a semicolon is inserted); 
and if it is indented less, then the layout list ends (a close brace is inserted).

The layout rule matches only those open braces that it has inserted; 
an explicit open brace must be matched by an explicit close brace. 
Within these explicit open braces, no layout processing is performed for constructs outside the braces, even if a line is indented to the left of an earlier implicit open brace.
