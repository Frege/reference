# Lexical syntax

## Source code

Source code is a sequence of Unicode code points. It is recommended to keep source code in UTF-8 encoded text files. Compiler supports different encodings through the `-encoding` command line option.

.Example
 # use default encoding of the java platform
 java -jar fregec.jar -encoding DEFAULT your.fr
 # use russian encoding (not tested)
 java -jar fregec.jar -encoding KOI8_R your.fr
